- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Encapsulation helps the code to be more organzied, since we categorize different part of the code and intertwined them in groups. Praciticing repetitive skills throughout all four .java files helps to reinforce a few key coding skills in java. Trying to translate the instructions in README into functions help to practice translating word language into java language. However, I still need to remind myself on the built-in of for loop and other classes since it's different from pyton. Advice will be listen closely to what the teachers said in class, because it's diectly related to the homework content.
